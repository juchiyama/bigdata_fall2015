However, for the record, I know this guy. We grew up together in a small Arizona town. He was picked on a lot by the other kids so I took him under my wing. He never knew his parents so he lived with his grandma, what I found exceptionally bizarre was the relationship he had with his grandmother. She would breast feed him right in front of me even though he was twelve years old. Thinking back, I'm not even sure she could produce milk. I was too young to understand, but they both seemed to really enjoy it so I just tried to shrug it off.\nOnce we got to high school, he started getting isolated and weird. Girls were repulsed by him because he never showered and lacked any social skills. The janitor caught him masturbating a few times under the gym bleachers, pulling him out by his ankles and screaming at him in front of the whole gym class. The police eventually had to be called in because of this and he was sent away to an institution. He would mail me really depressing letters, writing about the progress he was making and how he missed his grandma and their \"special snack time\", but I just ignored him. He was a lost cause.\nHe was eventually released, we would cross paths in public from time to time and he'd try to talk to me, but I was with my girlfriend and he was just too strange for me to deal with anymore. One night he confronted me at a bar, it was clear he was harboring a lot of self-hatred and didn't know how to deal with it. He kept telling me he loved me, trying to grope my crotch. I pushed him away then a few of my friends had to bust him up a little bit to keep him in his place. I felt bad hearing him cry like he used to when we were younger, back when all the other kids would beat on him, but he was really out of line. I mean, grabbing somebody's junk without permission just isn't right.\nA few months later he was arrested for having an incestual relationship with his grandmother. She died of a heart attack during the arrest and he was sentenced to a few years in prison. It was all in the local newspapers; really embarrassing. He never could get over how he inadvertently killed the only woman he'd ever loved. I guess, from the stories I'd hear around town, the other inmates passed him around like a bag of Oreos while he was serving his time. He was even nicknamed \"The Human Blow-Up Doll\"; it's really depressing to think about.\nAnyway, he obviously has no other outlet for his pent-up frustration than to ~~make~~ repost shitty posts online in some weak attempt to vent a lifetime of rage and failure. He follows me around on reddit, trying like hell to insult me. I've explained to him that because of the life he chose to live, lacking any real education, he's very obtuse. The saddest part was, he didn't understand what the word meant, thinking I was insulting his now heavy-set physique. I felt so embarrassed for him when he kept trying to insist that obtuse meant fat, posting these long self-justifications, maintaining unconvincingly that he was intelligent.  It was so sad.\nSo go easy on him, guys. He thinks very highly of himself because of his strong fantasy life. I don't mind if you harass him a little to keep him in line, but please keep in mind, this guy's only sex life consisted of an eighty-seven year old woman and that was years ago.

You were the only disturbance, and were fully aware of the contents of this special conference today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ma&amp;#39;am,&amp;quot; Hermione raised her hand, though unnecessary, as she spoke before acknowledgement from Professor McGonagall once again. &amp;quot;I would like to point out that hers may very well be a natural reaction beyond a purely adolescent one, as to spend classroom time learning what we may rightfully perceive as profitless knowledge seems naturally preposterous.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a rare moment for Hermione, she poses a question in direct contradiction to her endless struggle to defend the values of Muggle culture and invention. &amp;quot;Why should we even acquaint ourselves with unreliable Muggle contraception?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because it is 98% effective, Hermione. And because you are all entering your fifth year, I am leaving the decision to you and your peers; to trust the effectiveness of your male counterparts&amp;#39; ability to correctly cast a contraceptive spell, or to have a back-up plan.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bowl of complimentary condoms on Minerva&amp;#39;s desk was wiped out by lunchtime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;" }

So I'm going to talk... like I said in Chicago, it's like the old movie saying, you try to avoid regulation, but you keep getting sucked back in.  I'd rather not talk about regulation.  I wish that the bit licence didn't exist.  I wish we didn't have to talk about it, but it's so damaging that I feel like I do have to.  I do have to address it.\n\nBut first, let me cover the other things that are on the Agenda.  We all know that bitcoin is an incredible tool for global change, and one place we see this is in the emerging markets.  I travel a lot.  I travel about half of the year outside the US: almost all of that in emerging markets, particularly the Middle East and other areas, and we can see first-hand the massive difference that bitcoin can make, because right now, as we speak, there are millions of people who do remittances from countries in places like the Middle East to their home countries, and that's a multi-billion dollar market that can be addressed.\n\nSo - there are groups that work on financial inclusion who track that more lives can be saved, as more people are entering the banking system, as more people leave the mass of the unbanked and have that base level of financial security, so it's not that much of stretch to say that bitcoin can actually save lives. It really can because it can help people out of poverty, and that really does save lives.  And there's a few different ways to do that that are really incredible.  One is as an economic tool. The power that bitcoin has as an alternative to traditional forms of currency which have been for a long time manipulated and in many cases not in favour of the people who are using those currencies.\n\nAnother way is the ease of use that Jason King talked about so eloquently earlier today.  The ease for people to make contributions, and that is just going to keep growing.  There's going to be a lot more great charity stories like the kind of things that Jason is doing, because bitcoin is such a superior tool for making those kind of donations, and we're going to see more of that with people who have an ability to give to those in need rather than going through the traditional intermediaries.\n\nAnd the other thing that is a huge benefit is that for the first time in history, we can have rich people and poor people on the same financial platform.  People like Mark Andreessen who is a wealthy and successful person.  He owns bitcoin.  He can be on the very same financial platform as somebody who up until now couldn't get any type of bank account - at all. So that's really significant.  It's a really big deal, and it's just one of the many reasons that bitcoin is going to change the world.\n\nThe other part of it is the blockchain technology: things like what Etherium is doing will also have great potential, with smart contracts and other things, to change the world as we know it.  There's a massive amount of good that can be done with this.  There are lives that can be saved.  There are aspects of property ownership and health and all these other areas which can be radically transformed by decentralisation and things that i) bitcoin the currency allows, and ii) bitcoin the technology.  It's a very big deal, and you know that already.\n\nWhich is why it's particularly troubling that we have these kind of regulations that are coming out.  How many people have read this bit-licence, or read parts of it?  I'll give you a couple of highlights.  According to the bit-licence proposal by Ben Lawsky, an unelected official, who as I said on twitter, 'We have a person who was not elected by anyone, trying to create laws that no one asked for, for problems that don't exist'.  In his wisdom, Mr Ben Lawsky has said 'Bitcoin companies can't hold profits in bitcoin'.  This is serious.  'Bitcoin companies can't hold profits in bitcoin'.\nLawsky also says (aside) anybody ever hear of a company called Blockchain?  Anybody ever associate with Blockchain in any way?  You are breaking the law if Ben Lawsky's proposal goes through.  The proposal says that you cannot associate with companies that have a virtual address.  As everybody knows, Blockchain is progressive and cutting edge, not only in their technology, but also in their corporate structure: they're decentralised in some ways.  They don't have a central office in New York and they haven't filed their papers and they do their work on the blockchain and in bitcoin. You pay them in bitcoin and they pay their employees in bitcoin. Illegal to associate with them if you want to be licenced in New York!\n\nEvery business, licenced under this licence, must have a compliance officer.  That means if you're a three person start up, you're going to have to have one of them be a compliance officer.\n\nOne of my favourites: no alt-coins allowed without a licence.  You can't invent a new altcoin.  So we have doge-coin - if somebody in the highschool wants to invent cat coin, they will be handcuffed and thrown in jail, according to Ben Lawsky.\n\nI could go on and on.  I'll just give one more of the many many many examples of the preposterous ridiculous anti-business, anti-competitive, anti-technology proposals in this ridiculous nonsense that this unelected official has come up with.  Tracking all names and addresses of every single person that purchases anything: Pepsi..., a donut..., you have to get their address.  It's so unbelievably ridiculous.\n\nThere is another provision: 'banks are exempt'.  Of course!  Banks are exempt from all of these things.  That serves a great public good, right?\n\nAlso, there's a law in New York that says that regulators like this, who are not law makers, they are not elected legislators, regulators are not allowed to just randomly create new things if there's a chance it will harm jobs, so New York Department of Financial Services actually says 'Oh no, this won't harm jobs in New York'.  How absolutely utterly offensive, and ridiculous.\n\nSo this is why I say, when a lot of people are like 'What's our strategy for dealing with Lawsky?'  I say 'absolutely not'.  He has proven himself to be -- and I don't mean this as rhetoric, I'm going to back it up in a second -- I don't mean this as rhetoric, trouble making talk.  It's easier for me to do what my colleagues do, and just say 'oh yes, great work', that's what I'm supposed to say as a registered investment professional of twenty years, I'm supposed to say 'great job, for your foresight in regulating bitcoin because it brings it \"legitimacy\"'.  But I cannot do that.  I have to say the truth.  And the truth, as hard as it may sound, as hard as it may be for me to say it, but if I'm really being honest, we have to call it like it is, and that is to say that Benjamin Lawsky is corrupt.  Why do I say that he's corrupt? Because clearly he's working with the banks.  There's absolutely no reason that I can think of that anyone can justify why banks should be exempt from this.  That's corruption.  I'm sorry.  It's a hard word, but it's true.\n\nI believe he's dishonest, and I'll give you one simple example.  Ben Lawsky met a fellow named Charlie Shrem, a friend of many of ours, almost every week, for a year, and then Ben Lawsky had his media show: his hearing, and the day before the media show, Charlie Shrem was arrested.  And by the way, Charlie Shrem would never have been arrested if he'd worked for HSBC, for being a suspect that he failed to file a suspicious activity report.  I mean, give me a break.  He's not exactly Bernie Madoff, who by the way, just in case we forget, that's Bernie Madoff the fraudster.  Bernie Madoff was a regulator.  He was on the board of NASDAQ.  He was chairman of the board of NASDAQ, and he was on the board of directors of NASD who's the main regulator, so let's not go out there too much in always thinking that the regulators are always creatively[?] preventing fraud.  They didn't prevent one of the greatest frauds by one of their own.  But anyway, Ben Lawsky claims it's a complete coincidence that Charlie was arrested.  Does anyone believe that?  I'm just calling it how I see it.\n\nI believe he's corrupt.  I believe he's lying to us.  I believe he's dishonest, and I believe he's violent.  Why is he violent?  Because he's threatening you - everybody who raised their hand and said they used Blockchain - everybody who thinks they might want to create an alt-coin - everyone who wants to create a business in China or Europe or the Middle East who will have one customer in New York.  He is threatening us with violence: he is threatening us to put us in prison when he has no mandate to do so from the public.  He was not elected by us.  So I call him violent.\n\nI call him corrupt.  I call him a liar.  I call him violent.  So why on earth are people in this space running to deal with this person?  If you must reach out to public officials, reach out to ones who have some semblance of caring what the public says.  Reach out to Andrew Cuomo.  Call him out on this.  'Governor Cuomo is anti-jobs, he's anti-progress, he's anti-technology'.  Those are facts because he is the one who appointed Ben Lawsky.  Personally I think it's a futile effort to deal with somebody, and I wouldn't do it in private life.  You wouldn't do it in business.  Why we feel the need to engage this person who's proven themselves dishonest and corrupt and violent?  Why?  We wouldn't do it in any other situation.  The only reason I can think of that we do it is the same reason that my friends and colleagues praise New York in public, on their tweets and then privately tell me that it's a complete joke.\n\n(continued)\n\n", "link_id" : "t3_2bqa4o", "is_root" : true, "body_html" : "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;** I couldn&amp;#39;t catch every word, but here&amp;#39;s my attempted transcript. **&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sticking around, I know it&amp;#39;s the end of the day.

So I call him violent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I call him corrupt.  I call him a liar.  I call him violent.  So why on earth are people in this space running to deal with this person?  If you must reach out to public officials, reach out to ones who have some semblance of caring what the public says.  Reach out to Andrew Cuomo.  Call him out on this.  &amp;#39;Governor Cuomo is anti-jobs, he&amp;#39;s anti-progress, he&amp;#39;s anti-technology&amp;#39;.  Those are facts because he is the one who appointed Ben Lawsky.  Personally I think it&amp;#39;s a futile effort to deal with somebody, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t do it in private life.  You wouldn&amp;#39;t do it in business.  Why we feel the need to engage this person who&amp;#39;s proven themselves dishonest and corrupt and violent?  Why?  We wouldn&amp;#39;t do it in any other situation.  The only reason I can think of that we do it is the same reason that my friends and colleagues praise New York in public, on their tweets and then privately tell me that it&amp;#39;s a complete joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(continued)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;" }

Get your hands on these types of items before they get embargoed, hold onto them until the embargo hits and then start listing them at a high price. This will simultaneously draw out other less patient sellers and you can buy up their stuff when they undercut you and you stand a chance of selling something like a War Hero&amp;#39;s Crystal for a stupidly large amount of credits.\nOnce the Pink Crystal supply is bought up, then you make your real money by listing them individually for 500k or more each. Understanding embargo dates and taking advantage of ridiculously cheap limited items on the GTN will make you a ton.\nFlipping stuff on the GTN is incredibly easy but time consuming and can be tedious. I&amp;#39;m in the process of selling a number of embargoed Aratechs right now and they sell about 1 every 3 days but I&amp;#39;m making 2.5mil each sale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;" }

There's three parts that are all equally ridiculous; 1. That people would be gullible/credulous enough to accept this as being genuine. 2. The obvious bias against less extreme feminists, and the one sidedness of it all 3. The stagnation of debate. It appears as though there's a general consensus, and nobody has anything interesting to say to liven up the discussion. As a direct result, this ends up getting reposted every couple of weeks. Every time I see it, I get frustrated that there is no awareness of the cyclical nature of what is going on. \n\nWhat is immediately evident to me in this thread is that the feminist message is being misrepresented. This seems to be a theme on imgur and reddit; I don't see many other socio-political movements getting stilted coverage around like this. So there are the points about Anita Sarkeesian and Feminist Frequency; of course she should be available to criticize. However, I've only seen two criticisms that are supposed to explain why she is not to be given any credit. Firstly, her kick starter campaign may have been a scam. Secondly, her analysis of Hitman: Absolution was completely irrelevant and was essentially a strawman. The second point is perfectly valid, but without evidence or supporting testimony, the first is little more than conjecture. And while it is perfectly fine to criticize Feminist Frequency for potentially being too radical and 'Feminazi', it is a mistake to assume that the writing and concepts behind the shows are infallible. Far from it. Just as criticism may be aimed at it, the show also requires the benefit of the doubt. Anita Sarkeesian is by no means an expert on video games, but the money she raised for her kick starter speaks to just how interested the public (gamers, and to a large extent, redditors, I would expect) are in hearing about it. It would be a mistake to focus solely on attacking the message without adding ones own voice. Unfortunately, while that has happened, another aspect of the reaction has been death threats. This makes it clear that Feminist Frequency strikes quite a deep chord with a lot of people. \n\nHe problem is not Feminist Frequency necessarily; it is the perception that Feminist Frequency represents a larger part of the 'feminist movement'. To even say that feminism is a clear cut ideal would be to disregard extremist views on both sides. I wholeheartedly encourage criticism of Anita whatsherface, but it needs to be at least backed up. Also you have to keep in mind that you shouldn't look at it as the person who is this problem; it's their ideas that you should take aim at. Attacking someone's character as a means to argue is a logical fallacy. \n\nThis is going to turn out to be awfully long winded. Ah well. My second point is related to the first to an extent. As long as the demonization and generalization of feminism goes on (saying that 'not all feminists are like that' in the background isn't going to dramatically alter how people think about it), there is going to be a kind of general soft spot for hearing these ridiculous and extreme views; a pleasure from being able to look at them and point at how stupid and ridiculous they are. However, once this goes too far, people end up poking fun of the more moderate viewpoint, and eventually you come across more and more people who are skeptical of feminism in general. Having subreddits like r/theredpill don't really help to keep the peace on the internet, when people usually base their opinions on first impressions, and where anonymity is king. \n\nA good policy would be to ignore those who seek attention by showcasing radical views about feminism; on either side. To shun or to marginalize the illogical arguments about rape (\"looking at me is rape!\" vs. \"it's not rape if she looked like she wanted it\"), patriarchy, etc. etc. is what we really should be doing. We're getting mired in pedantry, when we should really be using common sense to figure things out. Equality of opportunity is a good way to start.\n\nTo sum up, I think there should be more rational debate, rather than mockery of the fringe areas. Either that, or just forget about it for now and leave it to the people who's job it is to think about things like this, and move on to something more entertaining. If all we can do is end up repeating the same thing on a regular basis just so we can get a little bit of schadenfreude, than there really isn't any point in having the Internet. You might as well have regular shots of dopamine to make you feel good. \n\nTL;DR. Really you should read it because it's easier to understand. But basically; Don't be gullible. You can criticize, but get your facts straight and work out what you're criticizing and whether or not it's worth attacking. Feminism isn't bad. It would be a good idea to just ignore attention-seeking 'Feminazis' and really awful mysogynists. Think about it; if you ignore them, they won't be able to pass on their genes! Natural selection wins. It's important to realize that it should all be about equality. However that won't come easily unless we all work together rather than keep fighting over the radical parts of the philosophy. \n\nAlso keep in mind that people in general are a bunch of money grabbing bastards. Don't be surprised if some people are just assholes. Doesn't matter what gender they are, you've just got to push past it and get to the actual worthwhile discussion. \n\n\n", "link_id" : "t3_2cgwc8", "is_root" : true, "body_html" : "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, stuff like this really gets to me. There&amp;#39;s three parts that are all equally ridiculous; 1. That people would be gullible/credulous enough to accept this as being genuine. 2. The obvious bias against less extreme feminists, and the one sidedness of it all 3. The stagnation of debate. It appears as though there&amp;#39;s a general consensus, and nobody has anything interesting to say to liven up the discussion. As a direct result, this ends up getting reposted every couple of weeks. Every time I see it, I get frustrated that there is no awareness of the cyclical nature of what is going on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is immediately evident to me in this thread is that the feminist message is being misrepresented. This seems to be a theme on imgur and reddit; I don&amp;#39;t see many other socio-political movements getting stilted coverage around like this. So there are the points about Anita Sarkeesian and Feminist Frequency; of course she should be available to criticize. However, I&amp;#39;ve only seen two criticisms that are supposed to explain why she is not to be given any credit. Firstly, her kick starter campaign may have been a scam. Secondly, her analysis of Hitman: Absolution was completely irrelevant and was essentially a strawman. The second point is perfectly valid, but without evidence or supporting testimony, the first is little more than conjecture. And while it is perfectly fine to criticize Feminist Frequency for potentially being too radical and &amp;#39;Feminazi&amp;#39;, it is a mistake to assume that the writing and concepts behind the shows are infallible. Far from it. Just as criticism may be aimed at it, the show also requires the benefit of the doubt. Anita Sarkeesian is by no means an expert on video games, but the money she raised for her kick starter speaks to just how interested the public (gamers, and to a large extent, redditors, I would expect) are in hearing about it. It would be a mistake to focus solely on attacking the message without adding ones own voice. Unfortunately, while that has happened, another aspect of the reaction has been death threats. This makes it clear that Feminist Frequency strikes quite a deep chord with a lot of people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He problem is not Feminist Frequency necessarily; it is the perception that Feminist Frequency represents a larger part of the &amp;#39;feminist movement&amp;#39;. To even say that feminism is a clear cut ideal would be to disregard extremist views on both sides. I wholeheartedly encourage criticism of Anita whatsherface, but it needs to be at least backed up. Also you have to keep in mind that you shouldn&amp;#39;t look at it as the person who is this problem; it&amp;#39;s their ideas that you should take aim at. Attacking someone&amp;#39;s character as a means to argue is a logical fallacy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is going to turn out to be awfully long winded. Ah well. My second point is related to the first to an extent. As long as the demonization and generalization of feminism goes on (saying that &amp;#39;not all feminists are like that&amp;#39; in the background isn&amp;#39;t going to dramatically alter how people think about it), there is going to be a kind of general soft spot for hearing these ridiculous and extreme views; a pleasure from being able to look at them and point at how stupid and ridiculous they are.

If a concept doesn't explain anything, there's no reason to believe it exists.\n2. The concept of god(s) don't explain anything.\n3. Therefore, there's no reason to believe god(s) exist(s).\n\n(1) seems to be an endorsement of the principle of parsimony. Carrol justifies (2) by pointing out that the concept is inherently ambiguous, and one cannot derive predictions about the state of the world if gods exist. (3) follows.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm a fan of the position. Gregory Dawes provides an alternative justification for (2) in his [book \"Theism and Explanation\".](http://infidels.org/kiosk/article/a-review-of-gregory-dawes-itheism-and-explanationi-811.html).

The lower the better. Once you get very lean you could increase your carb intake without getting fat. White rice, potatoes, bananas are best carb sources along with raw milk. Don&amp;#39;t believe the healthy whole grain BS. It is only healthy if it is fermented for long time with old processes, e.g. sourdough whole bread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost 40 pounds of fat in 2 months without any sports/fitness activity. I also gained 22 lbs weight in last month while lowering body fat significantly on a GOMAD raw milk diet with Starting Strength program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Calorie counting, low-fat diets, high-carb diets, whole grains, health system, education system all BS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eat as much milk, meat, cheese, healthy oils (butter, coconut oil, olive oil) as you can and don&amp;#39;t worry about calories. You could even up your calorie intake by 2-3 K and gain weight while lowering body fat.
